excerpt: "Around 1500 students enter the famed premises of IIT Roorkee every year, to finally reach their dream destination, after having toiled for 2-3 years."
---

Each year, approximately 1,500 students gain admission to IIT Roorkee. This achievement marks the culmination of years of intense preparation and dedication. After enduring a demanding and often monotonous academic routine, these students finally have the chance to shape their future trajectories. Many graduates choose to pursue advanced studies, enroll in business schools, or launch entrepreneurial ventures. However, a significant proportion opt for on-campus recruitmentâ€”often a key motivation for joining an IIT. Campus placements are widely seen as the ultimate evaluation of the time and effort invested at the institute. The process involves a rigorous series of aptitude assessments, group discussions, and high-stakes interviews. This report from Watch Out! provides an in-depth analysis of the placement statistics and outcomes for 2024.

The placement season is divided into two phases. The first phase runs from December 1st to December 15th. The second phase begins in the first week of February and continues until the end of May. The recruitment process starts as early as the first week of October. During this period, companies begin their assessments and resume submissions, which unfold over the next two and a half months.
