It goes without saying that placements are a serious business for the student community of the institution, perhaps the reason for joining an IIT for many. From boatloads of aptitude tests, group discussions and resume submissions to clean shaven faces and suited up personas, they sure take a heavy toll on students. As the campus moves through the second phase of placements, we analyze the placements so far. This report considers all placements this academic year, **till February** (second phase of placements is still in progress) and throws light on the key trends and statistics.
