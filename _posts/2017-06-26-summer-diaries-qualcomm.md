### Making it there:

The selection process for Qualcomm is carried out in three rounds.

**Online test**: The initial shortlisting is done on the basis of this test which consists of three sections namely 

1. Quantitative and Verbal

2. Object Oriented Programming and Algorithms

3. Electronics/Software 

The third section is to be chosen by the student depending upon which profile they've applied for. One can opt for both the options (if interested) and extra time is allotted accordingly. The time given for each round varies from 25 to 40 minutes, which might seem quite less compared to the number of questions asked. So, time management plays an important role.
Right after the test, there is a presentation the next day which is to be attended compulsorily. It is here that they brief the applicants about the company and its work culture as well as announce the names of the shortlisted candidates for the next round which is carried out the same day.

**Technical Interview:** In this round, questions mostly about your past projects (if any) are asked. So, it is important to be up to date with your projects/previous internships. Also, if you do not have any projects in your resume related to the profile you've applied for, slightly modified questions from 'geekforgeeks.com' are asked to check your knowledge of mainly data structures. You may be asked to write a pseudo-codes of the same in the language you prefer.
 
**HR Interview:** If you have been selected for this round, the chances that you have already been hired as an intern are pretty high. In this round, they basically want to know how easily you can open up in a new environment. This round is more like a light conversation than an interview. A little knowledge about Qualcomm can be helpful here.
Apart from learning about algorithms and data structures from 'geeksforgeeks.com', a basic knowledge of Linux programming and practicing aptitude questions (interviewbit.com/puzzlersworld.com) is enough to crack the selection process successfully.

### Work:
<br>
Qualcomm is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services. The company headquarters are located in San Diego, California, United States and has 224 worldwide locations. It played a major role in the 3G and 4G industry and is now working to launch 5G networking soon. 
The internship commenced with the assigning a mentor and a manager to every intern. Most of the interns were given projects regarding testing or error handling of previously written codes. 
I worked in the WLAN Software Team and my project was to add a feature to record and handle the error that occurred when a user configured the WLAN Modem. The whole project was to be coded in C language using various other techniques like socket programming, etc. The main obstacle in my project was the file size in which all the configuration commands sent to the driver were to be recorded. This required an extensive use of different data structures and understanding previously written codes for VAP configuration. My mentor was very helpful and always available to clear all my doubts. The manager allotted to me, on the other hand, generally remained in his office and rarely checked on my progress during the internship. 
 
The work hours depend on your project and the team assigned. I used to stay in the office from 10 am to 6 pm while a few of my co-interns used to work in slots – 11 am to 4 pm and then after dinner – 9 pm to 12 midnight. The project is assigned considering that you are a two-month intern which means that the work is not very pressurizing. All that expected of you the completion of the project by the end of the internship. Apart from work, there are team lunches and outings organized weekly/monthly depending upon the team.

### Perks and fun:
<br>
Qualcomm takes very good care of its interns providing the best of facilities. All the interns are provided with luxurious apartments, cab service, gym, etc. Qualcomm offices are not exactly in the main city, so you may have to travel for an hour or more to find some happening places. However, the office buildings are well equipped with a lot of indoor game areas like foosball, TT, carrom and video games like FIFA too. The best part of doing an internship in Bangalore is that most of your friends are also in Bangalore, the center of India's technology industry. There are a lot of places in and around the city to have a good time. The pleasant weather adds up to the fun of bike trips around the place. Also, this city has some coolest places to dine in and the nightlife is amazing.  

Qualcomm also organizes many competitions and fun events. During my internship, there was a photography competition and a singing event organized for the employees and interns. A major part of a Qualcomm internship is the Qualcomm Idea Quest whereby all the two month interns have to submit a new idea related to the domains in which Qualcomm works and if the idea is selected, teams are made and funding is provided to execute the idea in not more than 15 days at the end of which, a winning team is announced. Also, there are various days celebrated by the company – Qliving day, in which we were taken to WonderLa, Qsocial day and many more.

### Key takeaways
<br>
Qualcomm is a great company to have an enriching experience and meet some of the best minds during your intern. This company provides you an in-depth view of how the corporate world works, letting you decide whether you want to join it or not. I would suggest to all the folks aiming for Qualcomm–software that you don't need to be an excellent coder or have a great resume with many projects, all you need is to be clear with your basics and you are good to go.
