WatchOut! Covered Arcade Kaishi , a Walk-In Event by ESports IITR which was conducted on 13th August, 2023 in SAC building. We also got the opportunity to interview a couple of senior members of the group.


**Watch Out!**-  Before we talk about the event, as ESports is a new group, please tell us a little about the work you do and how it is bringing a different experience for the campus junta.


**ESports**- As part of our initiative, we aim to create a thriving gaming community on campus, which will allow students to showcase their gaming skills and engage in healthy competition. Our club not only offers entertainment but also fosters teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem-solving skills among the members. Through our events, we strive to create a unique and inclusive experience that resonates with the campus junta, offering them a chance to connect, compete, and have fun in the world of ESports.


**Watch Out!**- What did the inception of the group look like, and what hurdles did you face while doing so?


**ESports**-The inception of ESports IITR began with a shared passion for gaming among students. Initially organizing small events, we faced challenges in obtaining funding and convincing the administration of ESports value. Dedication, persuasive communication, and showcasing benefits helped us secure sponsorships and grow the community. With support from students, faculty, and sponsors, we overcame obstacles and expanded our reach, hosting larger successful events.


**Watch Out!**-  Considering the opportunities ESports is giving us, what culture change is expected among the students at IITR?


**ESports**-Students at IITR are likely to experience a cultural shift due to the emergence of ESports. This transformation could manifest in several ways, such as fostering stronger teamwork, encouraging strategic thinking, and enhancing digital proficiency. A heightened sense of competition may also lead to increased social interactions among students during gaming events. The importance of maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle and prioritizing academic pursuits must also be emphasized, however.

**Watch Out!**- Coming back to what we came for, please describe the event Arcade Kaisihi.


**ESports**- The name of the Event is Arcade Kaishi 2.0. “Kaishi” means “to begin beginning to start initial”, as this event is exclusively for UG and PG freshers. This is the second edition of the event. The first edition was conducted last year and this year we are giving better goodies and gifts. Five games are being played in this year’s event: Rocket League, Tekken, FIFA, Jumpforce and Forza. The criteria for the leaderboard ranking depends on the count of consecutive victories and the shortest race completion time.

**Watch Out!**- What is the future timeline for the Group?  


**ESports**- In the future we are planning to conduct more exciting and thrilling events. In the coming month we are going to conduct our flagship event Resurrection which we introduced this very first time. This is going to happen after the MTEs so that the students can enjoy this event as much as possible. We chose this event because after MTEs and especially the intern season, we as a club and a  part of the gaming community, try to help our campus gamers to enjoy and move out the stress. And after this we will go for the recruitment of various verticals for this year and hunt for the passionate gamers and peoples who are very excited and passionate to grow the gaming culture in our campus. So, in the future we are coming up with more big events and workshops but for now i think we have the whole right to keep up the hype and excitement for the next.

**ESports**-The future vision of ESports IITR is to develop an extensive gaming community at IIT Roorkee, featuring large tournaments, collaborations with other universities, skill-based competitions with industry insights, a dedicated gaming space, and an active gaming community. IIT Roorkee's organization strives to build a culture of competitive excellence and camaraderie among gamers through the creation of skilled rosters for inter-collegiate tournaments.

**Watch Out!**- What are some of the notable Achievements of IITR ESports?


**ESports**-During the Inter-IIT Cultural Meet 5.0 held in January 2023, ESports was introduced for the first time, featuring two ESports titles: Valorant and FIFA. In Valorant, we assembled two rosters from IIT Roorkee, selecting players based on their past tournament performances. Our efforts resulted in securing a gold medal in Valorant with a resounding one-sided victory. Additionally, we achieved a bronze medal in FIFA. As this marked the inaugural introduction of ESports in the Inter-IIT Cultural meet, our performance exceeded expectations. We are determined to maintain this level of excellence in the upcoming Inter-IIT events.
